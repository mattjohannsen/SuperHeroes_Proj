Questions to be Answered
When faced with a problem, the first thought that comes to mind is to immediately find more information and/or a solution. Every time one of the instructors/developers run into an issue, they immediately begin asking themselves the questions below. 
Additionally, this is the standard professional format for seeking direction from a colleague or supervisor. Each must be thoroughly thought out, concise, and clear. 
Please answer the following questions and return in a group Slack message to all the instructors. In the meantime, keep researching and problem solving.
